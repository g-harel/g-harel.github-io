                <h1>Why You Need Us</h1>
                <p>Now some people think hiring a stylist is unnecessary, but in reality, many of us don't have time or energy to clean out our closets or buy that one white t-shirt, we always say we need. Free time is limited today and we rather spend these opportunities with our family and friends, going to the beach with our kids, going out to that new restaurant in the city, or even squeezing in that extra 2 hours of sleep .. I mean don't all those things sound WAY more exciting than wasting time in and overly air conditioned mall or in your disheveled closet???</p>
                <p>Whether you are; starting a new job and unsure of what to wear, a baby making machine with a body that doesn't stop changing or someone who travels for work so often that they can't even plan what they're doing the next day- we don't discriminate. Every client of ours have different commitments and lifestyles but in the end, the one commonality they do have, is that they all value feeling good inside and out, and know that confidence is key in handling whatever life obstacles present themselves. Whoever you are and whatever category you fall into, we're here to help all your fashion and styling needs so you have ONE less thing to worry about. You'll thank us later!</p>

                <h1>Sayra Who?</h1>
                <img id="aboutme" src="res/red.jpg" alt="portrait of Sayra Ashqar from unapologetic stylist in a red dress"/>
                <p>I'm Sayra Ashqar, born in the effortlessly cool city of Montreal, Canada into a family of die hard garment industry entrepreneurs. After attending grad school in Miami, Florida, I moved to Manhattan to begin a career managing a well known, mental health treatment center for people with Co-Occurring disorders. My friends and family, never understood how I fell into that line of work. I had always been the girl with the outspoken personality and bold sense of style, far better suited towards the family business. Looking back at those years, I knew I wanted a challenge and despite the grueling hours, constant political setbacks and little pay, the reason I stayed in that industry was solely a result of an overwhelming sense of happiness that came over me after watching one client after another achieve their personal milestones.</p>
                <p>Fast forward, a few years later and an eventual move from the city, to the suburbs of Westchester, my husband and I decided to start our family. I went back to work for a few months, but quickly after having my first child, I decided to become a full time mom and watch all those important "first's" that people always tell you about. I had no idea how much my lifestyle and identity was going to change. One day it was high heels, tailored suits and happy hours in the city and then all of a sudden my world was turned upside down, with a house filled of noisy toys and pacifiers in any possible hidden corner you can imagine. As a Super Mama, my lifestyle is complete organized chaos, but whether it's cleaning up 10 spills of milk in under 5 minutes, a 5 minute pitstop to the grocery store that turns into 2 hours, or out on a sexy date night with my husband, I always want to look and feel fabulous.</p>
                <p>I created Unapologetic Stylist, after realizing that many of us go through similar life transitions and lose ourselves or stop prioritizing our sense of style as a result. Sometimes it's inevitable, while we try balancing multiple duties between our personal and professional lives. Life just gets complicated and messy but let's just be honest here- it's way easier to deal with crap when you don't look like it yourself!</p>

                        <span class="quote">"A friend of mine recommended that I reach out to Sayra for an upcoming New York trip I had planned over the summer time. I was going to be travelling into the city over a few days with my family and I didn't want to waste time shopping the stores with so many other activities planned. I asked Sayra to look for specific items that I had my eye on for a few months and have them delivered to my hotel when I landed. She met me at the hotel and we tried on everything, including other pieces, I thought i'd never see myself in, but once I put some of them on- I felt pretty cool. She has great taste and all the pieces I got were perfect additions to my wardrobe. I get compliments on my clothes all the time, which is a major plus at my age. She's always available to email when i have a styling question and i've referred her to many of my friends since then. I'm so happy she started this company because it's clear she can do this job in her sleep."</span>

                        <span class="quote">"Funny enough, I literally met Sayra one day, while shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue. She and I were trying on shoes right next to each other and I decided to ask for her opinion on my choice. I felt so comfortable talking to her that I told her, I was shopping for an outfit for the upcoming graduation party I planned for my daughter, but didn't know what I was really aiming "to look like" that night. Luckily, she had the afternoon off, having completly sabotaged her entire afternoon but after 3 hours and 1 coffee stop, I came home with a great dress and some helpful styling ideas to help accessorize it. She came over a few weeks later, and we put together the whole outfit, with my own shoes and jewelry (with earrings I had actually never worn, but sat in my jewelry box collecting dust).  The whole "look" turned out better than I could ever expect. I definitly recommend reaching out to her when you're in the same position I was, she's so much fun and easy to work with, you won't be disappointed."</span>

I was in a style rut and desperately needed someone to edit my wardrobe and show me how to put together some killer go-to outfits. I was in awe of how easily Sayra shopped my closet and suggested must-haves for the season and basics to buy that would update and fill holes in my wardrobe. She truly has a sixth sense for fashion and an effortlessly cool style that I wanted to emulate. After one afternoon with Sayra, I went from feeling like I had nothing to wear to feeling excited about a closet full of possibilities!"</span>

Sayra came to my rescue by helping me edit my wardrobe: i.e. let go of clothes I had since College or wore 9 months pregnant.  Now as a working mom, I don’t have time to swift through a pile of clothes, so having only key pieces hanging helps me be more efficient and look more put together!  She even went above and beyond by creating work & leisure outfits with the clothes I have; and what trends I should watch for to complete my closet.  Sayra is like a style superhero- with the cape and high boots!"</span>

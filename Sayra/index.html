                <h1>Why You Need Us</h1>
                <p>Now some people think hiring a stylist is unnecessary, but in reality, many of us don't have time or energy to clean out our closets or buy that one white t-shirt, we always say we need but never actually buy.  Free time is limited today and we rather spend these opportunities with our family and friends, going to the beach with your kids, grabbing a drink (or 6) with the girls, going out to the hot new restaurant in the city, or even squeezing in that extra 2 hours of sleep because for once no one is going to stop you... I I mean don't all those things sound WAY more exciting than wasting time in and overly air conditioned mall, let alone your sometimes oddly smelling disheveled closet???</p>
                <p>Whether you are; starting a new job and unsure of what to wear for your new gig, a baby making machine with a body that doesn't stop changing or even someone who travels so much for work that can't even plan what they're doing the next day- we don't discriminate.  Every one of our clients have different commitments and different lifestyles but in the end, the one commonality they do have, is that they all know how feeling good inside and out, helps you become more confident to take on whatever life's obstacles have presented themselves. Whoever you are and whatever category you fall into, we're here to solve all your fashion and styling needs. So stop going back and forth: to splurge or not to splurge or thinking that a stylist is WAY TOO expensive- TRUST us, it's totally do-able and budget "friendly".</p>
                <p>Oh and P.S if you can sleep in for 2 hours on any weekend day of the year, there is zero further discussion, point blank, i envy you, and want to be you. Note to self- in my next life time, do not have kids and get more sleep!!!!</p>

                <h1>Sayra Who?</h1>
                <img id="aboutme" src="res/red.jpg" alt="portrait in red"/>
                <p>I'm Sayra Ashqar, born in the effortlessly cool city of Montreal, Canada into a family of die hard garment industry entrepreneurs. After attending graduate school in Miami, Florida, I moved to Manhattan to begin a career managing a well known, mental health outpatient treatment center for people with Co-Occurring disorders. The people that knew me, never understood how I fell into that line of work. I had always been the girl with the outspoken personality and bold sense of style, far better suited towards the family business. Looking back at those years, I knew I wanted a challenge and despite the grueling hours, constant political setback and little pay, the reasons I stayed in that industry was solely a result of the overwhelming sense of happiness I felt when watching clients achieve their personal milestones that kept me going.</p>
                <p>Fast forward, a few years later and an eventual move from the city, to the suburbs of Westchester, my husband and I decided to start our family. After I had my first child, I decided to become a full time mom. I had no idea how much my lifestyle and identity was going to change. One day it was high heels, tailored suits and happy hours in the city and then all of a sudden my world was turned upside down, with a house filled of noisy toys and pacifiers in any possible hidden corner you can imagine. As a super mom, my lifestyle is complete organized chaos, whether it's cleaning up 10 spills of milk in under 5 minutes, a 5 minute pitstop to the grocery store that turns into 2 hours, or out on a sexy date night with my husband, I still want to look and feel fabulous.</p>
                <p>I created Unapologetic Stylist, after realizing that so many of us lose ourselves at some point and perhaps stop prioritizing our style after having made major transitions.We are all trying to be our best, constantly balancing multiple duties between our personal and professional lives. Face it, life is complicated and messy but you on the other hand, will always be fabulous and so should your wardrobe!!!!</p>

                        <span class="quote">"A friend of mine recommended that I reach out to Sayra for an upcoming New York trip I had planned over the summer time. I was going to be travelling into the city over a few days with my family and I didn't want to waste time shopping the stores with so many other activities planned. I asked Sayra to look for specific items that I had my eye on for a few months and have them delivered to my hotel when I landed. She met me at the hotel and we tried on everything, including other pieces, I thought i'd never see myself in, but once I put some of them on- I felt pretty cool. She has great taste and all the pieces I got were perfect additions to my wardrobe. I get compliments on my clothes all the time, which is a major plus at my age. She's always available to email when i have a styling question and i've referred her to many of my friends since then. I'm so happy she started this company because it's clear she can do this job in her sleep."</span>

                        <span class="quote">"Funny enough, I literally met Sayra one day, while shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue. She and I were trying on shoes right next to each other and I decided to ask for her opinion on my choice. I felt so comfortable talking to her that I told her, I was shopping for an outfit for the upcoming graduation party I planned for my daughter, but didn't know what I was really aiming "to look like" that night. Luckily, she had the afternoon off, having completly sabotaged her entire afternoon but after 3 hours and 1 coffee stop, I came home with a great dress and some helpful styling ideas to help accessorize it. She came over a few weeks later, and we put together the whole outfit, with my own shoes and jewelry (with earrings I had actually never worn, but sat in my jewelry box collecting dust).  The whole "look" turned out better than I could ever expect. I definitly recommend reaching out to her when you're in the same position I was, she's so much fun and easy to work with, you won't be disappointed."</span>

I was in awe of how easily Sayra shopped my closet and suggested must-haves for the season and basics to buy that would update and fill holes in my wardrobe. She truly has a sixth sense for fashion and an effortlessly cool style that I wanted to emulate. After one afternoon with Sayra, I went from feeling like I had nothing to wear to feeling excited about a closet full of possibilities!"</span>

                        <span class="quote">"A friend of mine recommended I book a session with Sayra because I was going back to work after having 2 kids and I was drowning in outdated clothes ranging from size 2-10!  Sayra came to my rescue by helping me edit my wardrobe: i.e. let go of clothes I had since College or wore 9 months pregnant.  Now as a working mom, I don’t have time to swift through a pile of clothes, so having only key pieces hanging helps me be more efficient and look more put together!  She even went above and beyond by creating work & leisure outfits with the clothes I have; and what trends I should watch for to complete my closet.  Sayra is like a style superhero- with the cape and high boots!"</span>
